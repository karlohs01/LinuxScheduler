# LinuxScheduler
Linux based scheduler within C++ utilizing vectors. We were given 2 input files and tasked with applying them within our program that would generate the exact same output as 2 output files that we were also given.

**This was a team project from my Data Structures class**


**Description**
You are in possession of a program that's been parallelized and employs 𝑛 individual
threads to tackle a given list of m jobs or tasks. Threads operate on these tasks in
the sequence they appear in the input. Whenever a thread becomes available, it promptly
picks up the next job from the list. Once a thread commences processing a job, it
proceeds without interruption until the job reaches completion. In cases where multiple
threads vie for tasks from the list at the same time, the thread with the lower index
takes precedence. Each job comes with a precise processing time, which remains constant
across all threads. Your task involves determining both which threads will be
responsible for processing each job and when that processing will commence.

**Input Format**
The initial line in the input comprises two integers, 𝑛 and 𝑚. The subsequent line presents 𝑚 integers
denoted as 𝑡𝑖, representing the time in seconds required for any thread to complete
the 𝑖-th job. These times are listed in the exact sequence as they appear in the job
list from which threads draw their tasks. It's important to note that thread indexing
begins at 0.
The first line of the input contains integers 𝑛 and 𝑚.
The second line contains 𝑚 integers 𝑡𝑖 — the times in seconds it
takes any thread to process 𝑖-th job. 
The times are given in the same
order as they are in the list from which threads take jobs.
Threads are indexed starting from 0.

**Output Format**
Generate precisely 𝑚 lines of output. Each 𝑖-th line (using a 0-based index) must
consist of two integers separated by a space. These integers represent the 0-based
index of the thread responsible for executing the 𝑖-th job and the time, in seconds,
at which the thread will commence the processing of that particular job.
